The Odoo Plugin for Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) allows you to connect to Odoo, as input to read models from Odoo, and as output to write to and delete from Odoo.
This plugin also contains the Apache2 Odoo Java API, and is based on the old OpenERP plugin (kettle-openerp-plugin) from De Bortoli Wines Pty Limited (Australia).
